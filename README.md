# Motion Amplification Video

Motion Amplification Video (MAV) offers a groundbreaking solution for precise vibrational analysis across industries. Current methods are costly and often miss subtle vibrations, impacting sectors like automotive, power plants, medical, and engineering. MAV processes video clips to amplify motion details, facilitating defect detection. Hosted on the cloud, it drastically reduces costs, captures time waveforms, and performs FFT spectrum analysis for noise, vibration, and shock analysis.

Motion amplification is a video-processing method that detects subtle motion and amplifies it to a level visible to the naked eye. This technique involves the use of a proprietary camera, which captures high-definition and high-dynamic-range video data. Each pixel in the camera becomes an independent sensor, creating millions of data points in an instant.

The process of motion amplification involves decoding light to pull out information that is indicative of motion, even if that motion is too small for the camera to detect with normal methods. This allows for the visualization of complex vibration problems that may be invisible to the naked eye.

Motion amplification has various applications, including vibration analysis, routine condition monitoring programs, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis. It is ideal for visualizing complex vibration problems and can save time and costs in these processes.

Some examples of motion amplification in action include:

Visualizing the human pulse: Motion amplification can be used to visualize the subtle motion of the human pulse, allowing for the detection of changes in heart rate and rhythm.
Visualizing sound: Motion amplification can be used to visualize the motion of vibrating objects, allowing for the detection of sound waves and vibrations.
Visualizing hot air: Motion amplification can be used to visualize the motion of hot air, allowing for the detection of temperature changes and heat transfer.
Overall, motion amplification is a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing subtle motion, and has a wide range of applications in various fields.
